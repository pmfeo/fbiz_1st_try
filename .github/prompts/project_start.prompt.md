I am planning a project to create a web app similar to Forecaster.biz[https://forecaster.biz/].
Look here[https://forecaster.biz/what-is-the-forecaster/] to learn more.

Key features for MVP:
    [] Fundamentals[https://forecaster.biz/fundamental-analysis/]
    [] Overbought/Oversold[https://forecaster.biz/overbought-oversold/]
    [] Market Mood Indicator[https://forecaster.biz/market-mood-indicator/]

I need your help with the high level direction and inital tasks.

First use the Brave API to search for the below documentation:

This backend side will be written in Python[https://www.python.org/], using FastAPI[https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/], Supabase[https://supabase.com/], Pydantic[https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/], and Docker/Docker-compose[https://docs.docker.com/].

No caching nor ORM needed for the moment.

Then create a PLANNING.md and TASK.md file.

PLANNING.md: high level direction, scope, tech, etc.
TASK.md: initial tasks to knock out for the project
