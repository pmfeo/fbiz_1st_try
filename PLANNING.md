# Forecaster.biz-like Web Application Planning

## Project Overview
Building a web application that provides financial market analysis tools similar to Forecaster.biz, focusing on three core MVP features:
1. Fundamental Analysis
2. Overbought/Oversold Indicators
3. Market Mood Indicator

This documentation refers only to the Backend side of the application.

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.x (with venv and unicorn)
- FastAPI - For building high-performance REST API
- Supabase - As the database and authentication provider
- Pydantic - For data validation and serialization
- Docker/Docker-compose - For containerization and deployment
<!-- - AWS as a Cloud server and hosting solution. -->

### Architecture Decisions
1. **API-First Approach**: RESTful API design using FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI documentation
2. **Serverless Database**: Utilizing Supabase for PostgreSQL database without managing infrastructure
3. **Type Safety**: Leveraging Pydantic models for request/response validation
4. **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development and deployment environments

## MVP Scope

### Fundamental Analysis
- Basic financial ratios calculation
- Company financial data endpoints
- Historical data analysis

### Overbought/Oversold
- Technical indicators calculation (RSI, Stochastic, etc.)
- Historical price data analysis
- Signal generation endpoints

### Market Mood Indicator
- Sentiment analysis endpoints
- Aggregated market indicators
- Trend strength calculation

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: API response times under 200ms
2. **Scalability**: Containerized deployment for easy scaling
3. **Security**: Authentication and authorization via Supabase
4. **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
5. **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests

## Future Considerations
- Caching layer for performance optimization
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- ORM integration for complex queries
- Additional technical indicators
- Machine learning models for advanced analysis
